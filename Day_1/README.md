## Day 1 | June 13, 2023
 
### Today's Progress :
- Read Program Structure on JS Eloquent
- Solve 5 problems on conditional statements and loop structures in JS
- I learnt Markdown in order to write a better readme file (I know it is not JS related)

### Thought : 

I wanted to start with Function on Js and decided to solve some problems on LeetCode but struggled with it. 

I think I don't understand Scope on JS Functions yet so I decided to work on Conditional statement and Loop structure instead. I didn't won't procrastinate
