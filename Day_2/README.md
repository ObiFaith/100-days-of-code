# Day 2 | June 14, 2023

### Today's Progress :
- Complete my readings on Program structure
- Solved 3 exercises on the topic

### Thought :
- It was a bit difficult to display different values on the same line in JS (console.log() does not allow it) 
- Solving those exercises was fun and took me a while to solve with JS (Still on the point made above)
- I was happy when I finally got the last task working as expected (Was the most challenging among others)
