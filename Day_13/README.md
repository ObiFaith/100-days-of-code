## Day 13 | June 5, 2023

### Today's Progress :
- Read on Data Structure
- Leant the two ways to access a property: Dot and Square Bracket Notation

### Thought :
> Using Square Bracket Notation
```javascript
 console['log']('Hello World!') 
 ``` 
is equivalent to  
> Using Dot Notation
```javascript
 console.log('Hello World!') 
```
