## Day 3 : June 15, 2023

### Today's Progress : 
- Understood different types of Function in JS
  - Function Definition
  - Function Declaration
  - Arrow Function

### Thoughts : 
- It is interesting there are three ways to use functions in JS
- Understanding each of them I believe is important eventhough they are similar they are different.
